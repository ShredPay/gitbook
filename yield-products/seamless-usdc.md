# Seamless USDC

**About this vault**\
This Earn vault generates yield by supplying USDC into Morpho, using a strategy curated by Gauntlet for Seamless.

**What is Morpho?**\
Morpho is an on-chain lending protocol where suppliers earn yield by lending assets, and borrowers pay interest to borrow against over-collateralized collateral.

**01 Deposit in a Morpho Vault**\
Deposit USDC into this vault on the **Base network**. Your deposit is supplied to a curator-managed vault strategy, so always review curator strategy and exposure before depositing.

**02 Assets are supplied to Morpho Markets**\
The vault allocates deposits into Morpho lending markets whitelisted by the curator. Gauntlet manages allocations and caps to target risk-adjusted yield across high-demand collateral markets.

**03 Earn yield from borrowers**\
Yield comes from interest paid by borrowers who borrow USDC against collateral, and may also include MORPHO incentive rewards when available.
