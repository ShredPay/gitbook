# Aave V3 USDC

**About this market**\
This Earn opportunity generates yield by supplying USDC directly to the Aave v3 lending market on Base.

**What is Aave?**\
Aave is an on-chain lending protocol where suppliers earn interest by providing liquidity, and borrowers pay interest to borrow assets against over-collateralized collateral.

**01 Supply USDC to the Aave market**\
Supply USDC on the **Base network** to the Aave v3 USDC market. Your USDC becomes available liquidity for borrowers and can be withdrawn anytime (subject to available market liquidity).

**02 How your USDC is used**\
Your supplied USDC is pooled in the Aave USDC reserve. Aave automatically matches supply and borrow demand, and interest rates adjust dynamically based on utilization.

**03 Earn interest from borrowers**\
Borrowers deposit collateral and borrow USDC, paying interest back to suppliers. Your yield primarily comes from borrower interest and changes in market utilization over time.
