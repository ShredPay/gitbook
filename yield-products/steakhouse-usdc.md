# Steakhouse USDC

**About this vault**\
This Earn vault generates yield by supplying USDC into Morpho, using a strategy curated by Steakhouse Financial.

**What is Morpho?**\
Morpho is an on-chain lending protocol where suppliers earn interest from borrowers, who borrow only after posting over-collateralized collateral.

**01 Deposit in a Morpho Vault**\
Deposit USDC into this vault on the Base network. Your deposit is supplied to a curator-managed vault strategy, so always review curator strategy and exposure before depositing.

**02 Assets are supplied to Morpho Markets**\
The vault allocates deposits into whitelisted Morpho lending markets and manages caps to balance yield and risk (often targeting blue-chip/RWA-backed collateral).

**03 Earn yield from borrowers**\
Yield comes from borrower interest payments, and may include MORPHO incentive rewards depending on underlying markets.
