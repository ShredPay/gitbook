# 3rd Party Bank Processing Fee

Lower processing fees on larger deposits.

Deposit fees decrease as your deposit amount increases:

$1 – $349.99: 4.5%

$350 – $499.99: 3%

$500 – $999.99: 1.5%

$1,000 and above: 1%

These fees reflect combined third-party bank processing costs (e.g. ACH and Debit Card fees), not a ShredPay platform fee.
