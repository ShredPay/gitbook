# Moonwell Flagship USDC

**About this vault**\
This Earn vault generates yield by supplying USDC into Morpho, using a strategy curated by B.Protocol and Block Analitica.

**What is Morpho?**\
Morpho is an on-chain lending protocol where suppliers earn yield by lending assets, and borrowers pay interest to borrow against over-collateralized collateral.

**01 Deposit in a Morpho Vault**\
Deposit USDC into this vault on the Base network. Your deposit is supplied to a curator-managed vault strategy, so always review curator strategy and exposure before depositing.

**02 Assets are supplied to Morpho Markets**\
The vault allocates deposits only to Morpho Markets whitelisted by the curators, with caps and rebalancing based on risk parameters.

**03 Earn yield from borrowers**\
Borrowers post collateral and borrow USDC, paying interest back to the vault. The vault may also earn MORPHO incentive rewards.
